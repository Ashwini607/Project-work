# Stuffs related to RDF modeling 

 I used the Eclipse Java development tool and the Apache Jena to make RDF model. The model serialisations format are in N-triples, Turtle, RDF/XML, and N3.

Know more about the [Apache Jena](http://jena.apache.org)

 For example, you can see about a model "finalModel3": model has written in Java [finalModel3](https://github.com/Ashwini607/Project-work/blob/master/Documents/workspace/trial/src/trial/finalModel3.java) + model outputs in different serialisations format and SPARQL queries to query the model [click to see it](https://github.com/Ashwini607/Project-work/tree/master/Documents/finalModel3)
