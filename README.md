I have kept the chemblDatabase queries in a folder /Documents/EBIDatabase/Query. we can directlly run the query using 
terminal but for running on sparql-endpoint of database, remove the comment from query.  

Queries related to ChEMBL sparql endpoint: 
- [Retrieving the compound having activity standered type "IC50"  and standered unit "nM"](https://github.com/Ashwini607/Project-work/blob/master/Documents/EBIDatabase/query/IC50Compounds.rq)
