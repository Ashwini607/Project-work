# Stuffs related to RDF modeling 

 I have used Eclipse Java development tools and library of Apache Jena to make RDF model in different serialisation such as N-triples, Turtle, RDF/XML, and N3.

 To know more about Apache Jena just go [http://jena.apache.org](http://jena.apache.org)

 Complete guide for beginner to start Jena project in Eclipse just go [http://www.iandickinson.me.uk/articles/jena-eclipse-helloworld/](http://www.iandickinson.me.uk/articles/jena-eclipse-helloworld/)

- [Result of models in different RDF serialisation](https://github.com/Ashwini607/Project-work/blob/master/Documents)

 For example, you can see about a model "finalModel3": model written in Java [finalModel3.java](https://github.com/Ashwini607/Project-work/blob/master/Documents/workspace/trial/src/trial/finalModel3.java) + model output in different serialisations and queries related to this model [click to see it](https://github.com/Ashwini607/Project-work/tree/master/Documents/finalModel3)  
 You can visualise the model by uploading rdf file in RDF-Gravity tool. You can find it at [http://semweb.salzburgresearch.at/apps/rdf-gravity/](http://semweb.salzburgresearch.at/apps/rdf-gravity/)
